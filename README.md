A web presence barometer visualizing popular sentiment on top companies.

Informant aggregates social media data and produces a measure on online company sentiment and reputation. In tracking the state in real-time, Informant is able to give a clear picture of 'vox populi' opinions, whether they be spikes or smooth waves. Informant is meant as a stock market assistant tool, but also as an on-going narrative, visually analyzing real-time data into an immediate and concise scroll story.
